## Purpose

This is a simple Express.js website that supports user registration, user login,
and user management using [mynodejs](https://www.dennismburu.tech). mynodejs makes
handling user authentication really simple, and I wanted to build something to
showcase how you can quickly spin up a Node.js website with very little effort
and have all the user management taken care of.

Why am I using mynodejs? Because it makes the authentication component really simple, and
that's what I'm all about: *simple stuff*.
