## Purpose

This is a simple Express.js website that supports user registration, user login,
and user management using [mynodejs](https://www.dennismburu.tech). mynodejs makes
handling user authentication really simple, and I wanted to build something to
showcase how you can quickly spin up a Node.js website with very little effort
and have all the user management taken care of.

Why am I using mynodejs? Because it makes the authentication component really simple, and
that's what I'm all about: *simple stuff*.

## Prerequisites

If you don't already have an Okta account, please go create one:
[https://developer.okta.com/signup/](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Okta accounts are free and last forever, you can use them to store the users for
all of your applications, it's pretty nifty.

Now go clone this GitHub repository locally and change into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdegges/okta-express-login-portal.git
cd okta-express-login-portal
```
